## Leading a 25-Engineer AI Organization

### The mission and its stakes

In this project, I ran a simulated 90-minute engineering sprint using Cursor subagents organized into five parallel teams. The objective was to deliver a shareholder-ready software package while coordinating planning, governance, DevSecOps, incident response, and release management through AI-assisted execution.

The simulation focused on operational leadership at scale rather than individual coding tasks. The system was designed to test how AI agents can accelerate engineering throughput while still operating within governance, security, and delivery constraints.

### Setting up the engineering environment

I configured the environment using Node.js, Rust, Git, Docker, and Cursor Max Mode with subagents enabled. A GitHub repository was created with branch protection, Actions workflows, and CI enforcement before development work began.

This established the operational baseline for the sprint. Instead of allowing unrestricted automation, the environment enforced the same governance controls expected in production engineering organizations.

## Establishing Governance and Branch Protection

### Why governance matters for AI-augmented teams

Branch protection created a controlled delivery boundary where all changes required validation before merging into production.

This matters more in AI-assisted environments because automated systems can generate changes faster than humans can manually inspect them. Governance ensures all work remains reviewable, traceable, and reversible. The objective was not to slow velocity, but to prevent silent failures and uncontrolled automation drift.

## Sprint Planning Artifacts and Architecture Decision Records

### Strategic planning with ADRs, diagrams, and sprint plans

I generated architecture decision records, sprint plans, risk registers, team charters, and system diagrams before execution began.

This created operational alignment across all five engineering teams and established shared context for implementation. The repository was scaffolded as a monorepo containing a React dashboard and Rust gateway service, allowing frontend and backend workstreams to move in parallel.

### Architecture Decision Records as leadership artifacts

The ADRs documented why major technical decisions were made and what tradeoffs were accepted.

One example was selecting Axum over Actix-web for the Rust gateway. The decision prioritized maintainability, Tokio/Tower ecosystem alignment, and long-term operational consistency over raw throughput performance. This transforms architecture decisions from undocumented assumptions into durable engineering records.

## Configuring the Engineering Culture Layer and DevSecOps Pipeline

### Cursor Rules, Skills, Hooks, and Commands

I configured Cursor Rules, Skills, Hooks, and reusable commands to standardize engineering behavior across all AI teams.

This created an organizational control layer where engineering standards, coding expectations, and operational constraints could be enforced consistently. The environment functioned less like isolated coding sessions and more like a governed engineering platform.

GitHub Actions workflows were added for CI validation, security scanning, and deployment automation to ensure every change passed through the same delivery pipeline.

### Automated security gates with SAST, SCA, and secrets scanning

The security pipeline integrated Gitleaks, Semgrep, and Trivy into automated pull request validation.

Secrets scanning prevented credential exposure, Semgrep enforced critical SAST policies, and Trivy validated dependency and filesystem vulnerabilities. Any critical finding automatically failed the workflow, preventing unsafe code from reaching the protected branch.

This established security as a delivery requirement instead of a post-deployment review process.

## Delivering 25 PRs Through Parallel Sprint Execution

### Orchestrating five teams across a compressed sprint

The sprint execution phase coordinated five independent AI engineering teams operating simultaneously across scoped delivery tasks.

Teams Alpha and Bravo handled the first delivery wave while Charlie, Delta, and Echo executed parallel feature work and infrastructure updates. The sprint simulated the coordination overhead, dependency management, and merge sequencing required in large engineering organizations.

### How /multitask and worktrees multiplied throughput

Cursor /multitask enabled multiple AI agents to operate concurrently instead of serially. Git worktrees isolated each branch into separate working directories, preventing conflicts between parallel contributors.

This architecture dramatically increased throughput because implementation work could proceed simultaneously without repeatedly context-switching or stashing changes. Delivery time became bounded by the slowest execution path rather than cumulative task duration.

## Responding to a Murphy's Law Security Incident

### Simulating and containing a real-world security failure

Midway through the sprint, I triggered a simulated SQL injection incident and coordinated a parallel hotfix response using subagents.

The exercise tested incident response coordination under delivery pressure while maintaining governance and security validation. The system required detection, remediation, regression validation, and post-mortem documentation before the fix could merge into main.

### MTTR and prevention measures from the post-mortem

The incident was resolved in approximately eight minutes from discovery through validated merge.

Post-mortem analysis identified the failure path and introduced new prevention controls. Semgrep policies were expanded to detect raw SQL string construction, and Cursor rules were tightened to enforce parameterized query usage and repository-layer access patterns.

The important outcome was not just the fix itself, but the operational feedback loop that reduced the likelihood of recurrence.

## Delivering a Shareholder-Ready Executive Package

### KPI dashboard, executive summary, and retrospective

After sprint execution completed, I generated KPI dashboards, executive summaries, sprint retrospectives, and release artifacts.

The reporting layer translated engineering execution into operational metrics leadership could consume directly. Velocity, quality, security posture, incident response, and budget alignment were all surfaced through structured reporting and Mermaid-based visualizations.

### Quantifying velocity, quality, and security outcomes

The KPI dashboard tracked merged PRs, review-to-merge times, security gate pass rates, incidents, MTTR, and regression metrics.

The sprint achieved a 96% first-pass security gate success rate, with one SQL injection-class issue requiring remediation before final merge. Recording the metric honestly instead of retroactively normalizing the result created a more accurate operational signal for leadership review.

This reinforced that governance metrics are valuable only if they reflect real execution behavior rather than idealized reporting.

### Sprint retrospective and continuous improvement

The retrospective documented what succeeded, what failed, and what process improvements were introduced after the sprint.

The primary failure identified was the SQL injection pattern bypassing initial human review before automated controls detected it. Follow-up improvements included stronger Semgrep enforcement, expanded middleware validation, and updated security review requirements.

This created a continuous-improvement loop where incidents directly informed operational hardening.

## 💎 Secret Mission: Zero-Day CVE All-Hands Incident Response

### Cross-team coordination and board-ready post-mortem

The zero-day simulation introduced a high-severity dependency vulnerability requiring rapid organizational coordination.

Multiple teams operated simultaneously across remediation, auditing, release verification, and operational recovery tasks. Bravo became the critical path due to dependency and release validation constraints, while Charlie handled deployment verification and operational health checks.

The exercise demonstrated how AI-assisted teams can compress remediation timelines while still maintaining auditability, governance, and release discipline.

## Reflections and Key Takeaways

### Tools and concepts mastered

This project combined Cursor subagents, Rust, Node.js, Docker, GitHub Actions, and cargo-audit into a coordinated engineering execution environment.

The concepts reinforced throughout the sprint included DevSecOps governance, multi-team orchestration, incident response management, AI-assisted delivery workflows, sprint operations, architecture governance, security enforcement, and executive reporting.

### Time and challenge assessment

This project took approximately three hours to complete. The most difficult part was managing permission approvals and operational interruptions introduced by the Cursor execution environment.

Those interruptions highlighted a real-world constraint in AI-assisted engineering systems: orchestration overhead can become a bottleneck if automation boundaries and permissions are not carefully designed.

The most valuable takeaway was understanding how AI agents behave within organizational systems rather than isolated coding tasks.

The simulation reinforced that scaling AI engineering workflows requires governance, operational controls, delivery discipline, and incident-response maturity alongside automation itself.

The next area I want to improve is optimizing orchestration patterns for larger multi-agent engineering systems operating across longer delivery cycles.
